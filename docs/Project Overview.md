# Project Overview: Academic Mentoring Information System (AMIS)

## 1. The Problem: Inefficiency in Manual Coordination
The Bukidnon State University Computer Society (ComSoc) plays a vital role in supporting IT students, yet its mentoring operations are currently hindered by fragmented, manual processes. Reliance on physical logbooks, scattered spreadsheets, and informal group chats has led to:
*   **Inaccurate Tracking**: Difficulty in monitoring attendance and participation.
*   **Unorganized Records**: Critical mentoring data is often lost or hard to retrieve.
*   **Communication Gaps**: Inconsistent coordination between mentors and mentees.

These inefficiencies create an administrative burden that detracts from the core mission of academic support.

## 2. The Solution: A Centralized Digital Ecosystem
The **Academic Mentoring Information System (AMIS)** is the answer to these challenges. It is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed specifically to streamline the mentoring lifecycle for the College of Technologies.

**Who is it for?**
*   **Mentees (IT Students)**: To find guidance, book sessions, and track their academic growth.
*   **Mentors & Faculty**: To manage schedules, provide feedback, and document student progress.
*   **ComSoc Officers**: To oversee the entire program with data-driven insights.

## 3. The Strategy: Key Features & Technology
AMIS replaces manual clutter with a structured, automated workflow.

### Killer Features
*   **Smart Matching**: Automates the connection between mentors and mentees based on academic needs and expertise.
*   **Session Management**: Integrated scheduling for advising and tutoring sessions, eliminating back-and-forth messaging.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Digital logs for feedback, goals, and academic milestones, ensuring no student falls through the cracks.
*   **Real-time Communication**: Built-in chat and notifications to keep all parties aligned.

### Tech Stack (MERN)
The system is built on a robust, modern stack to ensure scalability and performance:
*   **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, accessible user interface.
*   **Backend**: Node.js & Express providing a secure RESTful API.
*   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for flexible, scalable data storage.
*   **State Management**: Zustand (Client) + React Query (Server) for seamless data flow.

## 4. The Impact: Empowering Academic Success
AMIS is more than just a digitization tool; it is a catalyst for educational improvement. By automating administrative tasks, the system allows mentors and officers to focus on what truly matters: **student development**.

*   **For the Organization**: Reduces the administrative workload on ComSoc officers and ensures data integrity.
*   **For the Students**: Promotes personalized learning and provides a consistent support structure.
*   **For the Department**: Creates a secure, efficient digital ecosystem that aligns with the standards of a modern IT institution.
