_Last updated: November 19, 2025_

BukSU Mentoring System ("the Platform", "we") is an internal application operated by the Bukidnon State University
College of Computing. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when mentors and mentees use
the Platform.

## Information We Collect
- **Account data:** name, email address, role (mentor or mentee), and profile metadata managed by BukSU administrators.
- **Scheduling data:** session titles, scheduled times, attendance, and feedback notes supplied by participants.
- **Uploaded materials:** files mentors upload for mentees via Google Drive. File storage and access rules follow
  Google Workspace sharing controls.
- **Activity logs:** system-generated records that help us diagnose errors and maintain audit trails.

## How We Use Information
- Provide authenticated access to the Platform and tailored dashboards.
- Schedule, record, and track mentoring sessions and related materials.
- Notify participants about session changes, reminders, and required actions.
- Improve reliability and security of the Platform through monitoring and analytics.

## Data Sharing and Storage
- Files uploaded through the Platform are stored in BukSU-managed Google Drive folders with per-user permissions.
- Personal information is stored in BukSU-managed MongoDB databases hosted on BukSU infrastructure.
- We do not sell or rent user data to third parties. Access is limited to authorized BukSU staff for support and
  compliance.

## Security
- All requests require authentication and are encrypted in transit using HTTPS.
- Administrative access is limited to authorized BukSU personnel who follow university security policies.

## Your Choices
